-> set_index(<column name>) - Used to update the existing index with new index from a column.
-> Opposite of the above method, reset_index. This generates new rangeIndex from 0 to len and the existing index as new column in the dataframe.
-> df[[rows][columns]] - Used to extract exact rows and columns based on explicit indices.
-> Adding a new row to df can be done in 2 ways.
     -> One way is to use append method with a dictionary and ignore_index param set to True as inputs.
     -> Other way is to using loc method to access the next element and assign a list.

-> df.duplicated() - Used to identify if any row is duplicate or not. Returns a series of Boolean values.
-> df.drop_duplicates() method to drop the duplicate rows. 'keep' parameter takes 'first' and 'last' as inputs, which indicate to keep the first row or the last row.
     -> keep also takes 'False' as parameter that drops all duplicates.
     -> Can provide a subset of data to check the duplicates.
