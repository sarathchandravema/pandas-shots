-> read_csv, used to read csv file.
-> -ve indexing works in pandas. With -ve, head excludes last n rows, while tail excludes top n rows.
-> Dataframe can be created manually using pd.DataFrame by row-wise and column-wise operations.
-> info() gives all the details about the dataframe.
-> describe() provides the stats about the data. With 'include=all' parameter it includes, string/object fields also.
-> rename used to rename the columns names as dict in input. "inplace=True" replaces the current DataFrame.
-> df.drop used to drop a record with an index or column. With index, axis =1 to be specified for columns and for rows axis=0. Another way is to use the parameter columns for dropping columns.

-> pd.Series is similar to np.ndarray, but we can edit the index to new values.
        Once indices are updated, accessing individual elements is based on the new or explicit index values, however slicing(2 to 5, [2:6]) of Series is based on both implicit, that starts with 0 till the end, & explicit indices.
-> loc and iloc are created to eliminate the confusion of explicit and implicit indexing. loc works for explicit and iloc works for implicit.
-> in case of loc, last index is included unlike list, numpy indexing.
